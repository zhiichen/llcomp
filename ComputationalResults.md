# Introduction #

In order to present our work, we have implemented some algorithms and tested the performance of the code generated by our translator.

Currently, we have tested the following codes:

  1. Pi
  1. Mandelbrot
  1. Molecular Dynamics
  1. Jacobi

All codes are using double precision floating point numbers, despite of the performance impact.

Up-to-date results will be published soon.
