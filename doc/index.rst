llCoMP Developer Documentation
==================================

.. sectionauthor:: Ruym√°n Reyes Castro <rreyes@ull.es>

llCoMP is a translator framework designed for *fast prototyping*. 
With a small development effort, developers can build translators from OpenMP/C to different High
Performance Computing languages, libraries and frameworks. Currently we have
implemented the CUDA Backend, but we have plans to implement new ones.

Also, llCoMP allows users to apply different optimization techiniques before 
translating, in order to optimize the final code. Although we plan to implement
several optimization techiques, it is easy for developers to implement their own.

Software Architecture
**********************************


.. _layered_design:
.. figure:: images/layered_design.png
   :align:  center

In the diagram (layered_design_), the different layers of the framework are exposed. 

The uppermost level contains the :mod:`Frontend`, which gives the tools required to transform 
the source code into the internal representation.

The :mod:`MiddleEnd` module encapsulates transformations from the IR to the IR, for example, 
loop optimizations or type data conversions.

Finally :mod:`Backends` module contains all the implemented backends

Tools to manipulate the internal representation (and do some other stuff), are packaged 
on the :mod:`Tools` module.

In addition, some utils and examples are presented in order to show the capabilities of the framework.
