|llCoMP| Developer Documentation
========================================================================

.. sectionauthor:: Ruym√°n Reyes Castro <rreyes@ull.es>

|llCoMP| is a translator framework designed for *fast prototyping*. 
With a small development effort, developers can build translators from OpenMP/C to different High
Performance Computing languages, libraries and frameworks. Currently we have
implemented the CUDA Backend, but we have plans to integrate more backends (see :doc:`futureWork`).

|llCoMP| MiddleEnd capabilities allows users to apply a predefened set of high level
optimization techiques (like loop unrolling or loop flatening), or to implement their own
set of high level optimizations.


|llc| Language
**********************************

|llc| language has been presented on several papers [Dorta:2006:BSL]_, as an effective language
for high performance computing. |llc| is a language based on |OpenMP|/C where parallelism 
is expressed using compiler directives. 

See more about |llc| in :doc:`llcLanguage`.
